Welcome to httpsnet's fork.<br>
This is a customized Synergism.<br>
The purpose here was chosen for my gameplay and the first development to understand VS Code, TypeScript and npm.<br>
Currently an alpha version of the public test. But I haven't told anyone about this repository, so only those who discover it can enjoy it.<br>
We've added a great variety of features. It will feel like an official future.<br>
